		"question": "Audio doesn't work, how do I fix?",
		"answer": "This could be one of two things: your browser doesn't allow audio autoplay, or audio isn't enabled. If audio isn't enabled, you can easily toggle it in Settings or in-game. If it is an issue with the browser, try one of the following tutorials: <br>- Safari (iOS) - Unfortunately there is no way to fix the issue. <br>- Safari (macOS) - https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/adjust-safari-auto-play-settings"

      "question": "I have never owned a game on the supported platforms. Where do I start?",
      "answer": "Click the '+' button, tap on Repos, tap on the Homebrew repo under Featured Repos, and then it will be added as a repo. Tap it, and find a game you like. All of the listed ROMs (except Mother 3) should be fine to be used without legal concerns. Any other repos will require ownership of the original game."
    },
    {
      "question": "I want to suggest a feature or report a bug. How do I do so?",
      "answer": "Use the below link, read the attached README, and submit an issue on our GitHub issue tracker: https://github.com/iGBAEmu/EclipseIssues/"

      "question": "I want to make a repo. Where do I start?",
      "answer": "The repo format is documented at the below link: https://gist.github.com/Shugabuga/64cea72c7853f6c610c765f1531eb85a"
    },
    {
      "question": "I am an iGBA user who wants to upgrade to Eclipse without losing my game progress. How do I do so?",
      "answer": "To do this, go to iGBA, open Settings, then tap 'Export State.' This will either download a file (which can be uploaded during setup) or display text (which can be pasted during setup), which will port all of your ROMs, save states, and skins to Eclipse. Make sure you tap the option that says 'Import Data from iGBA or Eclipse State...' to import your data during setup (it can be done later in Settings)."
    },
    {
      "question": "I am having issues and need to do some self-debugging. How do I do so?",
      "answer": "Eclipse has a built-in debugger as of version 1.0.9. To make it visible, go to Settings and tap on the navbar (with the word 'Settings') five (5) times to enable Debug Mode. Go into the debugger menu, and various options would be available (such as the ability to create an issue with all important information pre-attached, the states of various settings, and some buttons to force Eclipse to run certain tasks."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I add custom ROMs?",
      "answer": "To do so, you need two things: album art and a direct link. The direct link would typically end in .gba, .gbc, .gb, and .nes and would not be from a service like Google Drive, MEGA, or MediaFire (we recommend Dropbox or your own server, as we do not officially provide support for anything other than it and standard web/file servers). Press '+' and tap on Manual. Put in the direct link and the album art as needed, and then add it. If you did everything alright, it should run as intended."
    },
    {
      "question": "What games are recommended?",
      "answer": "Look through your stuff and find a physical cartridge. If you have none, you are limited to homebrew games for legal reasons. Please don't pirate games when using Eclipse."
    },
    {
      "question": "This ROM (added from a link) isn't working. Why isn't it?",
      "answer": "A good test is to first download the ROM locally and upload it to Eclipse directly. To do this, press the '+' button and tap Upload. Select your ROM from your files, and load it with the corresponding button.<br>- If the game is not a Gameboy Advance game and doesn 't load, the ROM is probably bad or doesn't work with Eclipse.<br>- If it is and it doesn 't, wait for the splash screen (it can take some time). <br>- If you see the splash screen and the Nintendo branding is gone or corrupted, the ROM file is not supported by Eclipse. <br>- If it works perfectly when uploaded, your issue is probably a bad URL.Make sure the URL downloads the ROM when it is visited and doesn 't display a download button. We recommend that you use Dropbox to store your ROMs, not sites like Google Drive, MediaFire, or MEGA (which are not officially supported)."
    },
    {
      "question": "I made a repo or skin. How do I get it featured inside of Eclipse?",
      "answer": "Please contact me (HeyItsShuga). Please note that no skins or repos that are not appropriate for children under twelve (12) would be featured, as well as repos that contain Nintendo-licensed games."
    },
    {
      "question": "I want iGBA back. How can I get it back?",
      "answer": "iGBA is depreciated, as Eclipse replaces it. Export your iGBA state (backup) and import it to Eclipse. Any iGBA features that weren't ported to Eclipse can be reported on our GitHub issue tracker (https://github.com/iGBAEmu/EclipseIssues, please read the README if you aren't familiar with GitHub) and should be brought over soon."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use iGBA repos with Eclipse, and if so, how?",
      "answer": "You cannot officially, but you can use @1GamerDev's shim to convert a repo to use Eclipse's new format, which makes links that can be used in Eclipse itself. The link to it is below: https://igbaemu.com/iGBARepoToEclipse.php"
    },
    {
      "question": "I am uploading a ROM to Eclipse but it isn't saved to the main menu. Why?",
      "answer": "This is a technical limitation. iOS's MobileSafari (which is what many users use) limit localStorage space to ~50MB, while many games (especially GBA games) can use up to 35 MB (like Mother 3). This probably will not be changed, as other parts of Eclipse also use this space for offline usage."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Eclipse work offline?",
      "answer": "Eclipse does work offline, but certain features (like repos and your game collection) will be disabled. To use a game offline, you need to upload it under '+.'"
    },
    {
      "question": "Are save states stored for uploaded ROMs?",
      "answer": "A game's save data should be restored when its file is re-uploaded."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there formal documentation on features like skins, repos, and share URLs?",
      "answer": "Yes, and it can be found at https://eclipseemu.me/docs/."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does saving work in Eclipse, and what systems are supported?",
      "answer": "The systems that support saving are GBA, GBC, and GB. The NES does not support saving. Saving is done like it is on the original console: going into the game menus and using the save function. After using the in-game save function, tap Menu, then Save, then wait a few seconds for Eclipse to save your game progress to your device (thirty [30] seconds is safe enough). A full (unofficial) compatibility list can be found at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ronmDFH7XWPr359usVspv90G9jLiPA_t9EYHChglTrE/edit."
    },
    {
      "question": "Eclipse is slow for me. Why is that?",
      "answer": "On devices worse than an iPhone 6s (or comparable), Eclipse will be slow, even if emulators like Delta or RetroArch work fine. Since Eclipse is Web-based and web browsers aren't as powerful as native applications or programs, performance hiccups are to be expected."
    },
    {
      "question": "What repos are recommended? Where can I find repos?",
      "answer": "A comprehensive list of repos is available at https://magnetardev.github.io/eclipserepos/. <br> <br> Please note that we don't encourage piracy, are not responsible the contents of any community repos, and will not add repos that violate Nintendo and the developer's copyright as a featured repo in Eclipse."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I delete Eclipse? I installed it via the profile and can't delete it normally.",
      "answer": "Remove the profile in Settings > General > Profile. We do not allow for home screen removal on the profile due to home screen removals not removing the profile in the progress, leaving it installed after Eclipse is seemingly deleted."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does this work with [platform]?",
      "answer": "Probably. Just go to https://eclipseemu.me/, use the online version, and [platform permitting] add it to your home screen/launcher/desktop.<br>- For desktop platforms, our Electron clients should work.This includes win32, macOS, and GNU - Linux[deb provided].They include Discord Rich Presence support!<br> - For Android - based OSes, you should be able to add Eclipse to your launcher in Chrome and other browsers. <br> - For iOS, either adding the web version to the home screen or using the profile works. They do the same thing but personally, I prefer adding the web version to the home screen.<br> - For Android / Amazon Fire TV, PS4, and Xbox One, it probably runs but it isn 't fun to use (controls).<br> - For Apple TV, watchOS, and the * Nintendo Switch, there is currently no support and it will probably not run properly. <br>- For UWP / Microsoft Store, we do not have a client.<br>- For browsers without JavaScript ** , Eclipse will not work.Ensure JavaScript is enabled and a decent browser(such as Chrome, Safari, or Firefox) are being used."
