# Eclipse
Eclipse is a multi-web-emu focused on making emulation as simple as possible. You should be able to just play the games you want. The goal is for there to be as little configuration as possible and offer a wide array of system support. 

## Systems
- NES
- SNES (Experiemental < v3)
- GG
- SMS
- GB
- GBC
- GBA
- PSX (v3)

## Development

#### NPM Scripts
* ðŸ”¥ `start` - run development server
* ðŸ”§ `dev` - run development server
* ðŸ”§ `build-dev` - build web app using development mode (faster build without minification and optimization)
* ðŸ”§ `build-prod` - build web app for production

#### Webpack
There is a webpack bundler setup. It compiles and bundles all "front-end" resources. You should work only with files located in `/src` folder. Webpack config located in `build/webpack.config.js`.

Webpack has specific way of handling static assets (CSS files, images, audios). You can learn more about correct way of doing things on [official webpack documentation](https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-management/).

#### PWA
This is a PWA. Don't forget to check what is inside of your `service-worker.js`. It is also recommended that you disable service worker (or enable "Update on reload") in browser dev tools during development.

#### Assets
Assets (icons, splash screens) source images located in `assets-src` folder. To generate your own icons and splash screen images, you will need to replace all assets in this directory with your own images (pay attention to image size and format), and run the following command in the project directory:

```
framework7 generate-assets
```

Or launch UI where you will be able to change icons and splash screens:

```
framework7 generate-assets --ui
```
