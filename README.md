# Eclipse
The multi-emulator that can never be revoked.

Eclipse is a multi-emulator built for the web. It can be used on Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS, etc. Anything that has a modern web browser can run it.


## Eclipse v3
Eclipse v3 will be the last complete refactor of Eclipse. Version 4 will focus on modularity, so that cores can be easily added, buggy areas can be easily traced, and older components can easily get updated. A list of new features can be found below:
- Rewritten from the ground up
- IndexedDB for extended storage
- Uploaded ROMs can be added to the library (via IndexedDB)
- Unzip files
- Cloud sync
- Improved Import/Export of States
- Custom HTML/CSS/JS framework (bye Framework7)
- More streamlined interface
- WebAssembly-based Core Support
- Fix the controls betterâ„¢
- Redesign
- Redesigned Website

## Dependancies (Cores not Included)
- TypeScript
- Vue
- Vue Router
- Webpack
- Babel
- TSLint
- LocalForage
- OpenSkin (v3)

## Design
WIP -- A Sketch Cloud link can be found here once it's done.
